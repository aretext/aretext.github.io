<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>This guide describes commands you can use to edit a document efficiently. It assumes you are familiar with the commands described in the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart</a>.</p>

<p>If you have used vim before, these will feel familiar. If not, this guide may feel a little overwhelming. Don't worry! You do not need to memorize all of these commands to use aretext effectively. The best way to learn is to choose a few commands that you think might be useful and practice until they feel comfortable.</p>

<h2>Insert and append</h2>

<p>In normal mode, type &quot;i&quot; to enter insert mode at the current cursor position. To insert at the position <em>after</em> the cursor, type &quot;a&quot; (short for &quot;append&quot;) instead.</p>

<p>To insert at the <em>start</em> of the line, type &quot;I&quot;. To append after the <em>end</em> of the line, type &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>From insert mode, you can return to normal mode by pressing the escape key.</p>

<h2>Delete</h2>

<p>To delete a single character in normal mode, type &quot;x&quot;. (In insert mode, you can use the backspace key instead.)</p>

<p>To delete a line, type &quot;dd&quot; in normal mode. To delete from the cursor to the end of the line, type &quot;D&quot;.</p>

<p>There are many delete commands of the form &quot;d<motion>&quot;, where <motion> is one of the cursor movement commands described in <a href="navigation.html">Navigation</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;d<span class="math inline">\(&quot; deletes from the cursor to the end of the line, because &quot;\)</span>&quot; means &quot;move the cursor to the end of the line&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;diw&quot; (which means &quot;delete inner word&quot;) deletes the current word under the cursor.</li>
<li>&quot;daw&quot; (which means &quot;delete a word&quot;) deletes the current word under the cursor and any trailing whitespace.</li>
<li>&quot;dh&quot; deletes one character to the left, and &quot;dl&quot; deletes one character to the right.</li>
<li>&quot;dj&quot; deletes the current and previous lines, and &quot;dk&quot; deletes the current and next line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Replace</h2>

<p>To replace the character under the cursor, type &quot;r&quot; in normal mode, then type the new character.</p>

<h2>Change</h2>

<p>In aretext, &quot;change&quot; means to delete some text then enter insert mode. This is useful for quickly changing a word or line.</p>

<p>To change the current word under the cursor in normal mode, type &quot;ciw&quot; (&quot;change inner word&quot;).</p>

<p>To change the current word under the cursor and trailing whitespace in normal mode, type &quot;caw&quot; (&quot;change a word&quot;).</p>

<h2>Put and yank</h2>

<p>When you delete text, aretext copies it to a hidden buffer. You can then insert the deleted text after the cursor by typing &quot;p&quot; (short for &quot;put&quot;) in normal mode. Alternatively, you can type &quot;P&quot; to insert the text before the cursor.</p>

<p>You can copy a line into the buffer by typing &quot;yy&quot; (short for &quot;yank&quot;) in normal mode.</p>

<p>If you want to copy/paste using your system's clipboard, you will need to add custom menu commands (see <a href="customization.html">Customization</a> for instructions).</p>

<h2>Inserting and joining lines</h2>

<p>To start a new line below the cursor and enter insert mode, type &quot;o&quot;.</p>

<p>To start a new line above the cursor and enter insert mode, type &quot;O&quot;.</p>

<p>To join the current line with the line below, type &quot;J&quot;.</p>

<h2>Indenting and outdenting</h2>

<p>To indent the current line, type &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>To outdent the current line, type &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;.</p>

<h2>Toggle case</h2>

<p>To change the character under the cursor from uppercase to lowercase, or vice versa, type &quot;~&quot;.</p>

<h2>Selection (visual mode)</h2>

<p>To start a selection, type &quot;v&quot; (short for &quot;visual mode&quot;). You can use the same cursor motions as in normal mode to move the end of the selection.</p>

<p>To select entire lines (instead of individual characters), type &quot;V&quot;.</p>

<p>You can use the following commands to modify the selected text:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;x&quot; and &quot;d&quot; both delete the selection.</li>
<li>&quot;c&quot; (short for &quot;change&quot;) deletes the selection and enters insert mode.</li>
<li>&quot;~&quot; toggles the case of the selection.</li>
<li>&quot;&gt;&quot; indents the selection.</li>
<li>&quot;&lt;&quot; outdents the selection.</li>
<li>&quot;y&quot; (short for &quot;yank&quot;) copies the selection.</li>
</ul>

<p>To clear the selection and return to normal mode, press the escape key.</p>

<h2>Undo and redo</h2>

<p>To undo the last edit, type &quot;u&quot; (short for &quot;undo&quot;) in normal mode.</p>

<p>To redo the last edit, press Ctrl-r (short for &quot;redo&quot;) in normal mode.</p>

<p>Aretext clears the undo history whenever a document is loaded or reloaded.</p>

<h2>Repeat last action (macros)</h2>

<p>To repeat the last action, type &quot;.&quot; in normal mode. This is useful for avoiding repetitive typing.</p>
