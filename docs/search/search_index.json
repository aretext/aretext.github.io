You can edit the config file using the <code>editconfig</code> flag:</p> <pre><code>aretext -editconfig\n</code></pre> <p>The configuration file is located at <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aretext/config.yaml</code>, where <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is configured according to the XDG Base Directory Specification. On Linux, this defaults to <code>~/.config</code>, and on macOS it defaults to <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>.</p> <p>When you open the config file, you should see something like:</p> <pre><code>- name: default\n  pattern: \"**\"\n  config:\n    autoIndent: false\n    hidePatterns: [\"**/.git\"]\n    syntaxLanguage: plaintext\n    tabExpand: false\n    tabSize: 4\n    showLineNumbers: false\n\n- name: json\n  pattern: \"**/*.json\"\n  config:\n    autoIndent: true\n    syntaxLanguage: json\n    tabExpand: true\n    tabSize: 2\n    showLineNumbers: true\n</code></pre> <p>Each item in the configuration file describes a rule. For example, in the snippet above, the first rule is named \"default\" and the second rule is named \"json\".</p> <p>Each rule has a pattern. The \"**\" is a wildcard that matches any subdirectory, and \"*\" is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters in a file or directory name.</p> <p>When aretext loads a file, it checks each rule in order. If the rule's pattern matches the file's absolute path, it applies the rule to update the configuration.</p> <p>For example, if aretext loaded the file \"foo/bar.json\" using the above configuration, both rules would match the filename. The resulting configuration would be:</p> <pre><code>config:\n  autoIndent: true           # from the \"json\" rule\n  hidePatterns: [\"**/.git\"]  # from the \"default\" rule\n  syntaxLanguage: json       # from the \"json\" rule\n  tabExpand: true            # from the \"json\" rule\n  tabSize: 2                 # from the \"json\" rule\n  showLineNumbers: true      # from the \"json\" rule\n</code></pre> <p>When merging configurations from different rules:</p> <ul> <li>For strings and numbers, the values from later rules overwrite the values from previous rules.</li> <li>For lists, the values from all rules are combined.</li> <li>For dictionaries, the keys from later rules are added to the merged dictionary, potentially overwriting keys set by previous rules.</li> </ul> <p>This is a powerful mechanism for customizing configuration based on filename extension and/or project location. For example, suppose that the style guidelines for a project mandate four spaces of indentation for JSON. You could add a new rule to your config that overwrites the tabSize for JSON files in that specific project:</p> <pre><code># ... other rules above ...\n- name: myproject json\n  pattern: \"**/myproject/**/*.json\"\n  config:\n    tabSize: 4\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"configuration/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":""},{"location":"configuration/#fixing-errors-on-startup","title":"Fixing errors on startup","text":"<p>If your YAML config file has errors, aretext will exit with an error message.
