<h1 id="files">Files</h1>

<p>Aretext is designed to integrate seamlessly with a terminal-based workflow. This strongly influences aretext's approach to managing files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It delegates window management to your terminal multiplexer or emulator. Each instance of aretext opens a single document at a time; to edit multiple documents simultaneously, you can use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tmux">tmux</a> to run multiple instances of aretext in the same terminal.</p></li>

<li><p>It provides no commands within the editor to move, rename, create files, or change the working directory. You can use your shell (outside the editor) for these functions.</p></li>

<li><p>It automatically reloads files that change on disk (unless there are unsaved changes). For example, if you run a code formatting tool that changes a file, aretext will automatically reload it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fuzzy-file-search">Fuzzy file search</h2>

<p>Aretext has built-in fuzzy search for files. This allows you to quickly find and open a file without leaving the editor:</p>

<ol>
<li>In normal mode, type &quot;:&quot; to open the command menu.</li>
<li>In the menu search bar, type &quot;f&quot; to select the &quot;find and open&quot; command, then press enter. (If there are unsaved changes in the current document, you will need to either save them first or force-reload to discard the changes.)</li>
<li>Type in the search bar to filter the file paths. Use arrow keys or tab to choose a file path to open.</li>
<li>Press enter to open the selected file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aretext always searches within the current working directory.</p>

<h2 id="opening-a-file-from-the-command-line">Opening a file from the command line</h2>

<p>To have aretext open a document immediately, pass the path as a positional argument like this: <code>aretext path/to/file</code>.</p>

<p>If you do not provide a path argument, aretext will start an empty document called something like &quot;untitled-1621625423.txt&quot; (the number is a Unix timestamp). You can either insert text and save this document (useful for writing quick notes) or use fuzzy file search to open another document.</p>

<h2 id="previous-and-next-document">Previous and next document</h2>

<p>Aretext remembers which documents you have opened in the editor. To return to the previous document:</p>

<ol>
<li>In normal mode, type &quot;:&quot; to open the command menu.</li>
<li>In the menu search bar, type &quot;p&quot; then select &quot;open previous document&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have opened a previous document, you can return to next document using the &quot;open next document&quot; menu command.</p>

<h2 id="unsaved-changes">Unsaved changes</h2>

<p>Aretext will warn you if a command would discard unsaved changes or overwrite changes made by another program to the file on disk. You must then decide to either force-save, force-reload, or force-quit.</p>

<ul>
<li>To force-save, select the &quot;force save document&quot; menu command. This will overwrite the changes on disk.</li>
<li>To force-reload, select the &quot;force reload&quot; menu command. This will discard unsaved changes and reload the document from disk.</li>
<li>To force-quit, select the &quot;force quit&quot; menu command. This will discard unsaved changes and exit the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-grep-to-search-files">Using grep to search files</h2>

<p>To search for a term in multiple files, you can create a custom menu command that calls <code>grep</code>. See <a href="customization.html">Customization</a> for instructions.</p>
