<h1 id="navigation">Navigation</h1>

<p>This guide explains how to navigate efficiently within a document. It assumes you know how to start the editor and switch between normal/insert mode (if not, please read the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart</a> first).</p>

<h2 id="scrolling">Scrolling</h2>

<p>To scroll up by half a screen, press Ctrl-u (&quot;up&quot;) in normal mode.</p>

<p>To scroll down by half a screen, press Ctrl-d (&quot;down&quot;) in normal mode.</p>

<h2 id="line-movement">Line movement</h2>

<p>To move the cursor to the last line, type &quot;G&quot; in normal mode.</p>

<p>To move the cursor to the first line, type &quot;gg&quot; in normal mode.</p>

<p>To move the cursor to a specific line number, type &quot;<number>gg&quot; in normal mode. For example, &quot;123gg&quot; moves the cursor to the start of line 123.</p>

<p>To move the cursor to the start of the current line (after any indentation), use &quot;^&quot;. Use &quot;0&quot; to move to the start of the current line <em>before</em> any indentation.</p>

<p>To move the cursor to the end of the current line, type &quot;$&quot; in normal mode.</p>

<h2 id="word-movement">Word movement</h2>

<p>A &quot;word&quot; in aretext is a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>If syntax highlighting is enabled, then the syntax language will define additional word boundaries. For example, when editing Go code, the text <code>foo.Bar</code> would treat <code>foo</code>, <code>.</code>, and <code>Bar</code> as separate words because the Go compiler would recognize these as separate tokens.</p>

<p>To move the cursor forward to the next word, press &quot;w&quot; in normal mode. Use &quot;e&quot; to move the cursor to the <em>end</em> of the current word, and &quot;b&quot; to move the cursor <em>back</em> to the start of the previous word.</p>

<h2 id="paragraph-movement">Paragraph movement</h2>

<p>A &quot;paragraph&quot; in aretext is a contiguous sequence of non-empty lines. To move the cursor to the next paragraph, type &quot;}&quot; in normal mode; to move to the previous paragraph, type &quot;{&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="text-search">Text search</h2>

<p>Aretext supports case-sensitive forward and backward search within a document. (It does not currently support case-insensitive or regular expression searches, but these features may be added in the future.)</p>

<p>To search forward, type &quot;/&quot; in normal mode, then type your search query. To move the cursor to the search result, press enter; to abort the search, press escape.</p>

<p>To search backward, type &quot;?&quot; in normal mode, then type your search query.</p>

<p>To repeat a search, type &quot;n&quot; in normal mode (this moves the cursor to the &quot;next&quot; result). To move the cursor back to the previous result, type &quot;N&quot; in normal mode.</p>
